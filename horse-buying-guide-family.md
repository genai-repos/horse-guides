## Introduction
Selecting the right horse for **Reined Cow Horse** (governed by the National Reined Cow Horse Association, [NRCHA](https://www.nrcha.com)), **Versatility Ranch Horse** (governed by organizations like the National Versatility Ranch Horse Association, [NVRHA](https://www.nvrha.org), and affiliates such as the Arizona Versatility Ranch Horse Association, [AZVRHA](https://www.azvrha.com)), and **Cowboying** (practical ranch work involving cattle handling, roping, and chores) is essential for success in these disciplines. Reined Cow Horse focuses on precision and athleticism in three events (herd work, rein work, cow work), rooted in vaquero traditions. Versatility Ranch Horse emphasizes all-around ranch horse utility across six events, including cattle work, reining, riding, trail, and conformation. Cowboying requires a durable, versatile horse for daily ranch tasks like herding, roping, and navigating terrain. This guide outlines the ideal horse characteristics, key pedigrees of legendary horses, and the best places to purchase suitable horses, based on information from NRCHA, NVRHA, AZVRHA, and relevant web sources. It also addresses whether a horse selected for cowboying can be used for Versatility Ranch Horse events with additional training, including suitability for ranch roping and doctoring, and identifies horses suitable for family use with kids.

## Horse Characteristics for Reined Cow Horse (NRCHA)

### Breed
- Predominantly **American Quarter Horses** (AQHA), with some **American Paint Horses** (APHA).
- These breeds are favored for their agility, strength, and innate cow sense, critical for NRCHA events.

### Bloodlines
- Seek pedigrees with proven cow horse sires like **Shining Spark**, **High Brow Cat**, **Peppy San Badger**, **Colonel Freckles**, or **Not Ruf At All**.
- These bloodlines are renowned for producing horses with exceptional athleticism and cow-working ability.

### Physical Traits
- **Conformation**: Compact, muscular build with strong hindquarters for quick stops and turns. Good bone structure to withstand intense maneuvers.
- **Height**: Typically 14.2–15.2 hands, balancing agility and power.
- **Athleticism**: High agility for spins, sliding stops, and fence work; quick-footed for herd work.

### Temperament
- Calm yet responsive, with a strong work ethic and natural cow sense.
- Must remain composed under pressure during dynamic cow work phases.

### Training/Skills
- Proficient in reining patterns (spins, sliding stops, lead changes).
- Strong cow sense for boxing, fencing, and circling in cow work.
- Experience in cutting or herd work to control cattle precisely.

### Considerations
- Horses with NRCHA show experience or training are ideal.
- Geldings are often preferred for consistency, but mares can excel if temperament suits.
- Focus on horses with proven performance in herd work, rein work, and cow work.

## Horse Characteristics for Versatility Ranch Horse (NVRHA/AZVRHA)

### Breed
- Primarily **American Quarter Horses** (AQHA), with some **American Paint Horses** (APHA) and occasionally **Appaloosas** or **Morgans**.
- AQHA dominates due to its ranch heritage and versatility across events.

### Bloodlines
- Sires like **Peppy San Badger**, **Shining Spark**, **Playgun**, **Colonel Freckles**, or **Paddys Irish Whiskey** are valued for cow sense and versatility.
- Foundation-bred Quarter Horses are popular for their durability and ranch work suitability.

### Physical Traits
- **Conformation**: Balanced, structurally correct for conformation classes, with adequate muscling and strong feet for durability across events.
- **Height**: 14.3–15.3 hands, suitable for varied tasks like trail and cow work.
- **Athleticism**: Quick and agile for reining and cow work, yet smooth-gaited for ranch riding.

### Temperament
- Calm, willing, and trainable, with the ability to “turn off” intensity after cow work for quieter events like trail or riding.
- Must be responsive yet relaxed for diverse tasks.

### Training/Skills
- Versatile skill set: reining patterns, cow work (boxing, some fencing), cutting, trail obstacle navigation, and smooth gaits for ranch riding.
- Comfortable with ranch tasks like dragging logs, opening gates, and ground tying.
- Conformation suitable for “Form-to-Function” judging in conformation classes.

### Considerations
- Horses with AQHA Versatility Ranch Horse or Stock Horse of Texas (SHTX) show experience are ideal.
- All-around ability is key, so horses with cutting or reining backgrounds but exposure to cattle are good candidates.
- Suitable for Novice or Limited divisions for beginners, requiring less specialized skills.

## Horse Characteristics for Cowboying

### Breed
- Primarily **American Quarter Horses** (AQHA), with some **American Paint Horses** (APHA).
- AQHA is preferred for its durability, cow sense, and suitability for ranch work, including roping and doctoring.

### Bloodlines
- Sires like **Driftwood**, **Hancock**, **Two Eyed Jack**, **Peppy San Badger**, or **King** are prized for producing tough, reliable ranch horses with cow sense and endurance.
- Foundation-bred Quarter Horses are favored for their ruggedness and practical ranch skills.

### Physical Traits
- **Conformation**: Stocky, strong-boned, with robust hindquarters and sturdy feet for long hours and rough terrain.
- **Height**: 14.3–15.3 hands, balancing maneuverability and strength for cattle work and trail riding.
- **Athleticism**: Agile for cattle handling and roping, yet steady for long rides and chores like fence checking.

### Temperament
- Calm, steady, and willing, with a strong work ethic to handle long days and varied tasks.
- Natural cow sense for herding and doctoring, with composure for unpredictable ranch situations.

### Training/Skills
- Proficient in basic cattle work (herding, sorting, holding), ranch roping, and doctoring livestock.
- Comfortable navigating terrain, crossing obstacles (e.g., creeks, logs), and performing chores like dragging or carrying gear.
- Minimal formal training, often developed through practical ranch experience rather than competitive events.

### Considerations
- Horses raised on working ranches with real-world experience are ideal.
- Geldings are preferred for their steady temperament; mares are suitable if calm and trainable.
- Prioritize durability and practicality over competitive polish for cost-effectiveness.

## Overlap Between Disciplines
- **Common Breeds**: AQHA and APHA are ideal for all three disciplines due to their athleticism, cow sense, and durability.
- **Bloodlines**: **Peppy San Badger**, **Shining Spark**, and **Colonel Freckles** are common in NRCHA and VRH, while **Driftwood**, **Hancock**, and **Peppy San Badger** are prevalent in cowboying, offering cow sense and versatility.
- **Traits**: All require a calm, trainable temperament and cow sense. NRCHA emphasizes competitive precision, VRH focuses on all-around ranch utility, and cowboying prioritizes durability and practical skills like roping and doctoring.
- **Preference**: Geldings are favored across disciplines for consistency, but mares with good attitudes are competitive. Cowboying horses may need less formal training than NRCHA or VRH horses.

## Suitability of Cowboying Horses for Versatility Ranch Horse Events
A horse selected for cowboying can be used for **Versatility Ranch Horse** (VRH) events with additional training, as its practical ranch skills provide a strong foundation for VRH’s diverse requirements. Below is an analysis of its suitability, including for ranch roping and doctoring, and the training needed to bridge the gap.

### Compatibility with VRH Events
- **Ranch Cutting**: Cowboying horses with experience herding and sorting cattle have natural cow sense, making them well-suited for ranch cutting with minimal additional training. They may need practice in precise cutting maneuvers for competitive scoring.
- **Ranch Reining**: Cowboying horses often have basic maneuverability but may lack the polished reining patterns (spins, sliding stops, lead changes) required for VRH. Training to refine these movements is necessary for competitive performance.
- **Working Ranch Horse**: The cow work component (boxing, some fencing) aligns well with cowboying skills like herding and doctoring. Horses used for ranch roping are particularly suited for higher divisions requiring roping. Additional training may be needed for fencing or circling in competitive settings.
- **Ranch Riding**: Cowboying horses are accustomed to varied gaits and terrain, making them adaptable to ranch riding. Training to achieve smooth, precise transitions and competitive patterns is required.
- **Ranch Trail**: Skills like navigating terrain and obstacles (e.g., gates, logs) are inherent in cowboying horses. They may need practice with specific VRH obstacles (e.g., ground tying, dragging logs) to meet show standards.
- **Ranch Conformation**: Cowboying horses with balanced, sturdy builds (common in **Driftwood** or **Hancock** lines) are suitable for “Form-to-Function” judging, requiring no additional training if conformation is sound.

### Ranch Roping and Doctoring
- **Ranch Roping**: Cowboying horses used for roping (e.g., heading or heeling) are well-prepared for VRH working ranch horse classes in higher divisions (e.g., Open), which include roping. Their experience with lassoing cattle for branding or sorting translates directly to competitive roping tasks.
- **Doctoring**: Cowboying horses trained to hold or position cattle for doctoring (e.g., treating injuries or administering medication) excel in VRH cow work, particularly boxing and controlling cattle. Their calm temperament under pressure ensures reliability in these tasks.

### Additional Training Needed
- **Reining Precision**: Cowboying horses need training to master VRH reining patterns, focusing on smooth spins, sliding stops, and lead changes to meet competitive standards.
- **Show Polish**: Exposure to show environments and practice with VRH-specific patterns (e.g., ranch riding, trail obstacles) will enhance competitiveness.
- **Fencing/Circling (if applicable)**: For VRH divisions requiring fencing or circling, cowboying horses may need training to perform these more intense cow work maneuvers.
- **Consistency**: Regular practice to refine transitions, obstacle navigation, and cattle control will ensure the horse meets VRH scoring criteria.

### Conclusion
A cowboying horse with a **Driftwood**, **Hancock**, or **Peppy San Badger** bloodline is highly adaptable to VRH events with targeted training, particularly for Novice or Limited divisions where requirements are less intense. Its existing skills in cattle work, roping, and doctoring provide a strong foundation for ranch cutting and working ranch horse classes, while its terrain navigation suits ranch riding and trail. With 6–12 months of focused training under a skilled trainer, a cowboying horse can become competitive in VRH, especially if it already excels in ranch roping and doctoring.

## Horses Suitable for Family Use with Kids
Some horses can serve dual purposes, excelling in **Reined Cow Horse (NRCHA)**, **Versatility Ranch Horse (NVRHA/AZVRHA)**, and **Cowboying** while also being safe and gentle for family use with kids. This section outlines the requirements, recommended bloodlines, and sources for such horses, ensuring they are beginner-safe for children while meeting competitive or practical ranch needs.

### Requirements for Family-Friendly Horses
In addition to meeting the guide’s requirements for NRCHA, VRH, and cowboying, horses suitable for family use with kids should have:
- **Temperament**: Exceptionally calm, patient, and forgiving, with a “babysitter” disposition to tolerate inexperienced riders, sudden movements, or loud noises from children.
- **Training**: Well-broke, with extensive handling and exposure to various environments, ensuring reliability for novice riders. Desensitization to obstacles, noises, and crowds is ideal.
- **Versatility**: Capable of low-intensity recreational riding, trail riding, or light lessons for kids, alongside competitive (NRCHA/VRH) or practical (cowboying) tasks.
- **Conformation and Size**: Balanced, sturdy build, typically 14.2–15.2 hands, to accommodate both kids and adults safely. Smaller sizes (closer to 14.2 hands) may be easier for children to handle.
- **Age**: Mature horses (8–15 years old) are preferred for their experience and settled temperament, though younger horses with extensive training can work.
- **Health**: Sound with no behavioral or physical issues that could pose risks to inexperienced riders.

### Recommended Bloodlines
Certain bloodlines are known for producing horses with calm, trainable temperaments ideal for family use, while still excelling in NRCHA, VRH, or cowboying:
- **Two Eyed Jack**: Produces calm, willing, versatile horses with steady dispositions, ideal for kids in trail riding or light lessons. Excellent for VRH (ranch riding, cow work, roping) and cowboying (roping, doctoring), with moderate NRCHA suitability with training.
- **Peppy San Badger**: Versatile across all disciplines, with trainable, often calm dispositions in ranch-bred lines. Suitable for kids in recreational settings, excellent for VRH (all events) and cowboying (cattle work, roping), and suitable for NRCHA with training.
- **Driftwood**: Produces tough, athletic horses with steady temperaments when mature, ideal for cowboying (roping, doctoring) and VRH (cutting, trail) with training. Suitable for kids in trail riding or light ranch tasks.
- **Paddys Irish Whiskey**: Known for smooth-gaited, easy-going horses, excellent for VRH (ranch riding, trail, cow work) and cowboying (riding, chores). Their calm nature suits kids for trail or lessons, with moderate NRCHA suitability with training.
- **Hancock**: Rugged, big-boned horses with calm, dependable temperaments, perfect for cowboying (all tasks) and VRH (cow work, trail) with training. Suitable for kids in recreational riding when well-trained.

Bloodlines like **Shining Spark**, **High Brow Cat**, **Metallic Cat**, **Colonel Freckles**, and **Playgun** are excellent for NRCHA and VRH but often produce high-energy horses, less ideal for kids unless extensively trained to be beginner-safe.

- **Test the Horse**: Ensure the horse can perform required maneuvers (e.g., reining patterns for NRCHA/VRH, cow work for all disciplines, roping/doctoring for cowboying). Work with a trainer to evaluate suitability.
- **Pedigree Check**: Verify bloodlines for cow sense and versatility (e.g., Shining Spark, Peppy San Badger, Driftwood). Prioritize sires with proven performance in the desired discipline.
- **Budget**: Well-trained NRCHA/VRH horses with show experience may cost $15,000–$50,000+, while ranch-bred cowboying horses or younger VRH horses range from $5,000–$15,000. Family-friendly horses typically fall in the $5,000–$15,000 range.
- **Location**: Focus on regions like Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Arizona, or Montana, where ranch horse breeding is prominent.
- **Divisions**: For beginners, consider Novice or Limited divisions in VRH or ranch-bred horses for cowboying, requiring less specialized skills. Experienced riders should seek horses with show or work records.
- **Family Use**: For kids, prioritize mature (8–15 years) AQHA geldings with **Two Eyed Jack**, **Peppy San Badger**, or **Driftwood** bloodlines, tested for kid-friendliness and extensive handling.
